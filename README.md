singletutgrp.py
minirecords.csv

we will base our code on a single tut grp first for simplicity

multipletutgrp.py
records.csv

we will then implement the entire csv file, where we only have to change 
the read csv file and the write csv file, while the large part of the main
logic in the code does not have to change

however, the teams assigned will not increment without resetting after 
each tut grp
    we will solve this by implementing a simple up counter in the 
    write csv file function
the code should reflect this change as can be seen from the # in the code



Document your definitions, what exactly constitutes a balanced team? What led to your approach with evaluating how balanced a team is? What level of tolerance do you allow a team, to be considered "balanced"?

Document your thought process. Could be how you derive your algorithm, what optimisations you have made to it to improve it's efficacy (To make team formation more balanced). Treat the reader as a monkey who knows nothing. Let someone who knows nothing about your approach proofread it even.

Document your justifications. Could be why not all teams can be considered "fairly balanced" by your definition.
