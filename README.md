singletutgrp.py
minirecords.csv

we will base our code on a single tut grp first for simplicity

multipletutgrp.py
records.csv

we will then implement the entire csv file, where we only have to change 
the read csv file and the write csv file, while the large part of the main
logic in the code does not have to change
